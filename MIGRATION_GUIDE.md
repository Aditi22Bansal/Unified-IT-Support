# Migration Guide: Fixing Ticket Persistence Issue

## Problem
Tickets were being deleted every time you relogin because the system was using in-memory storage (`simple_main_enhanced.py`) instead of persistent database storage.

## Solution
The system has been updated to use database-backed storage (`main_dynamic.py`) which persists tickets across server restarts and user sessions.

## Quick Fix

### Option 1: Use the Migration Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd backend
python migrate_to_database.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
cd backend
# Setup Prisma database
prisma generate
prisma db push

# Initialize with sample data
python init_database.py

# Start the database-backed server
python main_dynamic.py
```

### Option 3: Use the Dynamic System Startup
```bash
# This will handle everything automatically
start_dynamic_system.bat
```

## What Changed

### Before (In-Memory Storage)
- Used `simple_main_enhanced.py`
- Tickets stored in `tickets_db = []` (in-memory)
- Data lost on server restart or relogin
- No persistence

### After (Database Storage)
- Uses `main_dynamic.py`
- Tickets stored in SQLite database via Prisma
- Data persists across restarts and sessions
- Full CRUD operations with persistence

## Updated Files

1. **`run_enhanced_backend.bat`** - Now runs `main_dynamic.py` instead of `simple_main_enhanced.py`
2. **`README.md`** - Updated to show correct server file
3. **`migrate_to_database.py`** - New migration script
4. **`start_dynamic_system.bat`** - Already correctly configured

## Verification

After migration, verify that:
1. Tickets persist when you logout and login again
2. Tickets persist when you restart the server
3. You can see tickets in the database file (`backend/dev.db`)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Database not found**: Run `prisma generate` and `prisma db push`
2. **Migration fails**: Check that all dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. **Port conflicts**: Make sure port 8001 is available
4. **Permission errors**: Run as administrator if needed

## Need Help?

If you're still experiencing issues, check:
- Database file exists at `backend/dev.db`
- Prisma client is generated (`backend/prisma/generated/`)
- All Python dependencies are installed
- No port conflicts on 8001

The system now provides full ticket persistence and enterprise-grade features!
